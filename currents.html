    <h2>What are the patterns of currents?</h2>
    <p> Currents are mainly just water streams that go to different places, and it would be important to know about their systems for how water can affect climate, such as in rivers or just the coastline beach. Though there are different types of currents, such as the short ones that could just be a small waterway that just leads to a river or a waterway that goes from the North Pole to the South Pole. They normally are in predictable paths in the water that could consist of either fast waters or slower ones, sometimes depending on the depth, which could be low, or they are deep within the ocean waters, such as the border of the twilight zone. They are there to move and steadily flow waters from the poles to the equator from the waters that could have heat, and that heat or cold could have an important role in the role of making there be a system where the water could be at a moderate or median temperature throughout the ocean and how some places that are near the coastlines could be basically identical temperature. </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How do currents distribute temperature?</h2>
	<p> There are currents that affect the surrounding coasts that are near currents, and those currents affect the climate near the currents' pathway. Though the real part that affects the currents is the heat distribution and the ways that the currents move. The way that the heat is made and distributed is that when the sunlight from the sun hits the surface of the ocean, then the heat has now affected the water and that water goes through currents and those currents then go to their pathway to the coastlines nearby. They also distribute the ways of the currents, which still have the contained heat from the initial sunlight interaction; then the currents have the heat and the climate of the nearby coastline with the waves. Then this process of the waves hitting the beach is basically how the beach gets its humidity, and it's not really its temperature because the sunlight also hits the beach, so it is mainly the humidity.
