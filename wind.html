    <h1>What is the formation process of wind</h1>

    <p>
        The formation is that there are many factors that can affect how wind forms, but the main one is uneven heating through the Earth's surface, and that creates stronger wind.

    <p>
        Water heating is also a main factor, and water vapor plays a role in the atmosphere. The wind is first caused by uneven heating through the Earth. The main reason for the uneven heating is that land heats up faster than water, which causes air to rise faster over land than over water, creating wind in the first place.
