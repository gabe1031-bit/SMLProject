<h1>🌍 Continental Climate</h1>

<p>
Continental climates form in regions located far from large bodies of water. Because land heats and cools more quickly than water, inland areas experience large seasonal temperature differences.
</p>

<p>
During winter, temperatures drop rapidly as land loses heat quickly. Cold air masses dominate and snowfall is common. In summer, land absorbs solar energy quickly, causing temperatures to rise sharply.
</p>

<p>
In places such as Russia and Eastern Europe, the difference between winter and summer temperatures can exceed 40 degrees Celsius. Latitude, wind patterns, and distance from oceans are the primary factors shaping continental climates.
</p>

<p>  Continental weathers are weathers that vary in molecule movements, of which in the winters they move slowly, but in the summer they change in drastic lengths. Such as in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, temperatures can change by about 40 degrees Celsius, and that makes the change continental, in which it changes in the different seasons. There is also the cause, which is the meridians, and those meridians are the main factors.  </p>
