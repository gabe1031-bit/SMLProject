    <h2>What is the formation of earthquakes?</h2>
    <p> There is a natural disaster known as an earthquake that could cause mass destruction, though how do they form? Well, they form from tectonic plates when they slip from kinetic energy stored up in the area, and that causes a shake that lasts for a period of time that is known as an earthquake. There are actually 2 stages of an earthquake, of which it is a formation pattern between the earthquakes in which there is a main shock and then a slightly less but longer shock that could happen, and that shock is known as the aftershock, which is way longer and could be like an echo effect getting smaller and smaller for up to years at a time. There are also earthquakes that have a part of tectonic plates that has a shake, but it also moves the continents by about 2 inches due to slow levels of seismic activities. This leads to the continents moving every year from the earthquakes, and that leads to the slow movement of how the islands are a little different every year.

    <h2>How do volcanic eruptions form?</h2>
    <p> There are things called volcanoes that are usually associated with lava, which they do have, but how do they get this lava, and how do they erupt? Volcano eruptions are formed by the layer of earth that is liquid magma, which is a stage of lava but just not active. The volcano does have 2 stages, dormant and active, in which the dormant volcano just sits there building up pressure.  
While an active volcano is when that pressure is too much, and it just goes out of the funnel, and that causes liquid magma to go everywhere, which causes lava to be everywhere and ash to emit from the volcano lava, which would burn from the lava, making the ash be all in the air, causing catastrophe. There are also conditions of how volcanoes can erupt, which include the size of the volcano, which determines the amount of lava.

    <h2>What are the patterns of hurricanes, and what is the formation process?</h2>
    <p> Hurricanes are big groups of swirling storms that group up to form what is known as a hurricane, which is known as a natural disaster. The speed of this hurricane is about 74 for the strongest ones, which are the ones classified as a natural disaster. They are normally formed off of disturbances in the atmosphere, such as the waves, and when the waters are unusually warm from the direct sunlight. Though they do have to be about 200 miles in the ocean with some rare occurrences in the part of the equator. Then there is also the fact that hurricanes are named based on meteorology data on the winds that they occur by and the thunder and high-speed winds that they also have.

    <h2>What are typhoons, and how do they form?</h2>
    <p> Even though hurricanes are similar to typhoons, there are still some differences even though they are both known as tropical cyclones, but what exactly is a typhoon? There are multiple 	types of typhoons, which have the title of "tropical depression" for storms that are less than or exactly 39 miles per hour. Then there are the typical typhoons, which are in the range of 74 miles per hour, which is average. Although there is not a classification for higher storms, they are now just classified as a hurricane or a typhoon. Though unlike a hurricane, a typhoon originates and forms depending on the region, which could be the specific North Atlantic or the specific eastern northwest; it would be classified as a hurricane. Though if it is in the south, it is near the typhoon, mainly in the eastern part of Asia. Even though they are very similar, they still have some differences in where they are located and formed.

    <h2>What are tsunamis, and how do they form?</h2>
    <p>Tsunamis are somewhat related to volcanic eruptions or nearby earthquakes because of the movement of tectonic plates, which creates an impact that leads to a huge wave that is classified as a natural disaster called a tsunami. Tsunamis are colossal waves that are at a scale of 1-10 for the amount of disaster, and that is the lethality of the size of the waves that the tsunami is, usually caused by the speed and the impact of the tectonic plates of the earth, which is the main cause of a tsunami. You could typically tell if there is a tsunami by finding some unusually low tides followed by a distant but big wave. Though even the tsunami would normally be called a tidal wave, tidal waves are caused by the moon instead of movement and collision of them.

 <div class="section">
    <h2>What is a tornado, and how do they form? </h2>
    <p> There are things such as hurricanes and typhoons that are typically connected even though the tornado is much more different than these two. Though the main thing is that what actually is a tornado is not a swirling group of water; it is actually a narrow, really fast rotating wind that could go up to 300 mph in some really rare circumstances. They are also known to be the most violent natural disaster in the atmospheric section. Though they do have a specific time when they mainly do, which they do from about May to June in the middle section of the United States. Just like some other disasters, this could also be measured by the intensity of the tornado, which is typically the whirl or wind speed of said tornado. Though the real thing is really how they form, which is by a process called mesocyclone, which is not really a process, but it is a part of how the tornado forms. The tornado also needs some specific temperature, such as below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and the winds have to be in a circling pattern, with the wind also having to be strong enough to create the tornado, which leads to the disaster forming.

    <h2>What are blizzards, and what are the conditions for them to form?</h2>
    <p>There is such a thing as a blizzard that consists of snow and really makes it so that the area where the blizzard happened would happen, and that leads to conditions where there is such thick snow you can't see past it. Though the way that it is composed is from a combination of winter snow that happens with strong winds that overlap with each other to make hard conditions to see and makes it a natural disaster because it would be very dangerous. Though they are dangerous from a term called "without conditions," where it is really hard to see, the main thing is the flying winds that have really strong winds with the snow, and that snow is going really fast, and that could really injure you in a couple of ways, like hypothermia and hail, which could probably bruise you. Then the real reason for what actually is a blizzard is strong winds that create a harsh environment that could have been from snow on the ground that lifts or just winds with combined thick and harsh snow weather conditions to create this phenomenon known as a blizzard.

<div class="section">
    <h2>What are landslides, and how do they form?</h2>
    <p> There is a natural phenomenon called a landslide that is fatal to a lot of inland regions and has an effect on the environment, though how did they form? Well, they form from a lot of materials moving in a huge mass, which leads to a gigantic part of blockage. Then the formation process is a little different. Though there are a lot of conditions that could happen, the most consistent way that it happens is a huge but loose hill on a mountain biome that would make it so that there would be a danger for the people that live near, mainly in the inland, because landslides are affected by the altitude and the gravity of which there is, which could lead it so that landslides go all the way down to the bottom of the lands, which have many effects near all the villages nearby. Then the real reason why it is classified as a natural disaster is because the materials vary from hardened dirt and mud, and the real danger, which is boulders and rocks, has the ability to ruin the buildings at the bottom, at which the buildings could be destroyed to where you could have mass damage in the aftermath of the landslides that would happen and make it the conditions for natural disasters.
