<h1>🌵 Drought</h1>

<p>
A drought is an extended time of weather where the levels of precipitation are lower than the average of what they normally are. The causes of a drought can be found with low precipitation, and with this low precipitation, it makes the landscape dry, and that makes the surrounding vegetation have more of an effect on how it would actually grow. Basically the dry season is a period of time when there is low humidity, and if there had not been rain in a certain period of time, it would be the process they call condensation. 

</p>

<p>
Droughts commonly develop when high-pressure systems remain over a region for extended periods. High pressure prevents air from rising, which reduces cloud formation and limits condensation. Without condensation, rainfall becomes scarce.
</p>

<p>
As soil moisture decreases, crops and vegetation struggle to grow. Rivers shrink, reservoirs drop, and groundwater levels fall. Severe droughts can impact ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies.
