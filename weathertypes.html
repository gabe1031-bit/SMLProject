    <h2>How does polar weather form?</h2>
    <p>  Polar weather is seen in such places as mainly the poles and other parts of the world near the poles. However, how it is formed is that there are things such as polar vortices that make forceful and hypothermic winds that can reach distances up to 5-9 miles in winds that are below freezing temperature. This makes the Arctic have polar temperatures, which are boundaries separating the warm from the cold, making the colder places even colder. Those colder places have more of an impact with this, and that is the impact of latitudes and how it really affects the boundaries of the air. If it is actually becoming more of a cold place from blocking the warm air from the north and south, making it forever cold in the very north and south of the poles.
