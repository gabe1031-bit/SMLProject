Radiation is not what you think, and it is actually heat that spreads in a circular pattern in all directions and lets it have a drier and more heated texture instead. This factor of radiation is dependent on a lot of factors, such as climate, weather, geographical location, and time, making it have more of a change if it is hot or cold; mainly, it is hotter and has more of a spread, and that spread has multiple layers of heat where the center heat is slowly going out to the edges and heating everything in a small area. Depending on the factors of the location around it, it could spread either rapidly or slowly and in a smaller or larger area. The main example of radiation is the sun, where the sunlight that we are getting on the earth is mainly the sunlight from which the sun is beaming upon us. Though it is about 93 million miles away at the current moment, it takes about 8 minutes for the radiation to get to Earth to emit sunlight. With this radiation this leads to things becoming heated and letting more stuff have the power of radiation in terms of sunlight , which is anything that heats in an area that expands outward.
